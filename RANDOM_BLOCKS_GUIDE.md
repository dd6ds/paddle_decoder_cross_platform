# 🎲 Random Blocks Training Mode - User Guide

## Overview
The **Random Blocks Mode** generates random combinations of characters and numbers from selected sessions. This helps you practice recognizing characters in ANY order, not just memorized words!

## ✨ What Is Random Blocks Mode?

Instead of practicing specific words like "TEA" or "TENT", Random Blocks creates random character combinations like:
- **2 chars**: "AN", "T4", "E2"
- **3 chars**: "NET", "5A1", "THO"
- **4 chars**: "SENT", "4TE2", "HOLD"
- **5 chars**: "STONE", "14T2N", "HORSE"
- **Dynamic**: Random length from 1-5 characters

## 🎯 Why Use Random Blocks?

### Benefits
✅ **No memorization** - Every combination is random
✅ **Real-world practice** - Like copying random callsigns
✅ **Character recognition** - Focus on individual sounds
✅ **Progressive learning** - Select which sessions to include
✅ **Flexible difficulty** - Adjust block size and session range

### When to Use
- After learning characters in a session
- Before moving to next session
- To reinforce character recognition
- To prevent relying on word patterns
- To practice for contests or QSOs

## 🔧 Tips & Tricks

### Tip 1: Start Small
Don't jump to full range immediately:
- Session 1 only first
- Then 1-2, then 1-3, etc.
- Master each level before expanding

### Tip 2: Use Dynamic Wisely
Dynamic blocks (1-5 chars) are great for:
- Simulating real QSOs
- Varying difficulty
- Preventing boredom
- Testing true mastery

### Tip 3: Mix With Word Practice
Alternate between:
- Random blocks (character recognition)
- Word practice (pattern recognition)
- Both skills are important!

### Tip 4: Adjust WPM
- Lower WPM: Focus on accuracy
- Higher WPM: Build speed
- Start slow, increase gradually

### Tip 5: Use Listening Mode
Random blocks + Listening mode = 
**Best training for real-world copying!**

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**Q: Blocks are too hard**
A: Reduce session range or block size

**Q: Blocks are too easy**
A: Increase session range or use Dynamic

**Q: Same characters appear often**
A: This is random! Some repetition is normal

**Q: Can't recognize characters in blocks**
A: Go back to single-session, 2-char blocks

**Q: Want only letters, no numbers**
A: Choose session ranges without numbers
   (e.g., Session 1 has no numbers)
